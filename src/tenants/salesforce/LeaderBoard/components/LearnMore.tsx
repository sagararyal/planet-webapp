          We believe business is one of the greatest platforms for change. We
          commit to creating a sustainable, low-carbon future for all. That
          means reducing emissions, as well as protecting and improving carbon
          sinks, like forests.

          Climate change disproportionately affects the most disadvantaged and
          vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing economic and racial
          inequalities. It’s critical that we take bold steps now.
